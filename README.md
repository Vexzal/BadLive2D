An attempt at creating an editor to mimick the functionality of the animation program Live2D
in order to get similar models and animations but exportable in a more useable format.
(Eventually stopped because the project this was for moved away from using live 2D)
(it needs a lot of work and retooling, was my first try at making a program like this so the design is pretty bad)
